# wind_power_insights

This project is divided into the following sections

## power_generation_data

1. This folder contains the original copy of the data for four locations (Location1.csv, Location2.csv, ...) as well as a readme.txt that came as part of the data from Kaggle
2. An R markdown file containing a basic exploration of the data, including checking for data quality, identifying trends between explanatory variables and the target variable, and transforming the data to be more suitable for machine learning modeling. This file was then formatted into a HTML for ease of viewing (power_generation.html)
